## An Autonomous Vehicle State Estimator
This section was implemented in three parts: In the first part of the project, implement the Extended Kalman Filter (ES-EKF) by completing the provided code for filter prediction and correction steps. Evaluate the filter's accuracy by comparing estimated vehicle positions with ground truth data. In the second part, analyze the impact of sensor miscalibration and adjust filter parameters to compensate. In the third part, explore the effects of sensor dropout on position estimates, highlighting drift and uncertainty changes during measurement unavailability
