# Vehicle Control For Self-Driving-Car

![Cover](./media/cover.gif)

## Vehicle Dynamic Modeling

The first task for automating an driverless vehicle is to define a model for how the vehicle moves given steering, throttle and brake commands. This module progresses through a sequence of increasing fidelity physics-based models that are used to design vehicle controllers and motion planners that adhere to the limits of vehicle capabilities.

## Vehicle Control

The final project in this course involves the development of control code for a self-driving car to navigate a racetrack within the CARLA simulation environment. The project requires the construction of longitudinal and lateral dynamic models for the vehicle, followed by the creation of controllers that manage speed and path tracking performance using Python.
